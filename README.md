# eBooks Search Engine

The MERN stack, which includes a React front end, a MongoDB database, and a Node js & Express js server, is used by the Book search engine. Users can examine the books and their details and save book searches to their profiles. Users can click a link in the application that directs them to Google Books by using the Google Books API. The Apollo Server and GraphQL API were used to build the search engine.
